            This problem demonstrates how to override ranges keys to provide targeted feedback for a common incorrect student answer.
            
            In this example the answer is 10.  Ranges have been setup similarly to the Default Example with a range added at the end.  This additional range catches the common incorrect answer of 1000 with a score of zero and provides targeted feedback to help the student understand their mistake.
