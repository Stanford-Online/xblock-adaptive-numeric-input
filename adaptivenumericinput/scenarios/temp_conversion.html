            This examples demonstrates how credit dictionaries are sorted.  
            
            Answer is 0.278.  Full credit is given for any answer within 1% but different feedback is desired for an exact answer. Also half credit is given for answers less than 60% off but different feedback is wanted for 40, 50 and 60 percentiles(0.2, 0.16, 0.13).
           
            Sorting is by highest score, calculated student_error, error_percent, and then error_absolute. Don't use error_percent and error_absolute for answer groups with the same score.
